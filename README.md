### üìñ Help

* [Windows] Build shows `libssl-1_1-x64.dll` not found

  Install OpenSSL add it to the path

  ```
  choco install openssl
  ```

  ```
  scoop install openssl
  ```

  

* [Windows] Problems with `libmysql.dll` (in binary or Diesel CLI)

  Install the C-Connector from [here](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-c/) to a directory and it to the path like this:

  ```
  setx MYSQLCLIENT_LIB_DIR "<your path>"	
  ```

  Also put `libmysql.dll` from the C-Connector to the folder of the Diesel binary in `C:\Users\<user>\.cargo\bin` if you still encounter problems with the Diesel CLI.

  

* [Windows] Problems with connecting to MySQL databases (binary or Diesel CLI)

  For now, Diesel on Windows does not support `SSL` for MySQL. In order to use it, one must disable SSL on the Server.

  ```
  sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  ```

  Now add following command

  ```
  [mysqld]
  ...
  skip_ssl
  ...
  ```

  

* Migrations with Diesel CLI

  If you want to run the migrations with the CLI (is not needed/recommended) you can run

  ```
  diesel setup --database-url "mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3306/iprp"
  ```

  ```
  diesel migration run --database-url "mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3306/iprp"
  ```

  

* [Windows] Building Rust-Crypto (dependency) fails on MinGW

  Set environment variable `CC=gcc`
